##Finding a small effect. So now you see there is an effect in the x of our data. this x * 0.068 itÂ´s telling the data that there should be an effect of X on the Y.

  ggplot (aes(x=p.value)) + geom_histogram()  
#with the 0.068 I am telling the response when the x affects the y. The less dependency, more like the first histogram, less probable that there is a connection. When I added 0.068 I am moving my pvalue towards 0 because there is a higher probability that there is an effect.
