```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
No need to hashtag, because it is a text. ** = things become bold. 
In the chunk, (gray part), is possible to write the code.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

<!-- Ctrl + shift plus C, this has the same function of the hashtag in a normal file. When I knit, it generates a document but this here wonÂ´t appear.-->

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
